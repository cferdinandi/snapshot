## Getting Started

Compiled and production-ready code can be found in the `dist` directory. The `src` directory contains development code.

### 1. Include Snapshot on your site.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/snapshot.css">
```

Snapshot is [built with Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for easy customization. If you don't use Sass, that's ok. The `css` folder contains compiled vanilla CSS.

The `_config.scss` and `_mixins.scss` files are the same ones used in [Kraken](http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/), so you can drop the `_snapshot.css` file right into Kraken without making any updates. Or, adjust the variables to suit your own project.

### 2. Add the markup to your HTML.

```html
<img class="img-circle" src="#">
<img class="img-border" src="#">
<img class="img-photo" src="#">
```

Add simple `.img-*` classes to any `img` element to add styling. You can combine classes for additional styling options. Mix-and-match as desired.

And that's it, you're done. Nice work!



## Installing with Package Managers

You can install Snapshot with your favorite package manager.

* **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):** `npm install cferdinandi/snapshot`
* **[Bower](http://bower.io/):** `bower install https://github.com/cferdinandi/snapshot.git`
* **[Component](http://component.io/):** `component install cferdinandi/snapshot`



## Working with the Source Files

If you would prefer, you can work with the development code in the `src` directory using the included [Gulp build system](http://gulpjs.com/). This compiles, lints, and minifies code, and runs unit tests. It's the same build system that's used by [Kraken](http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/), so it includes some unnecessary tasks and Sass variables but can be dropped right in to the boilerplate without any configuration.

### Dependencies
Make sure these are installed first.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [Ruby Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) `sudo npm install -g gulp`

### Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required files.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
	* `gulp` manually compiles files.
	* `gulp watch` automatically compiles files when changes are made.
	* `gulp reload` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/).



## Browser Compatibility

Because IE 8 and lower do not support the `border-radius` property, `.img-circle` will not work in those browsers.

Snapshot is fully supported by IE 9 and higher, and all modern browsers.



## How to Contribute

In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Don't forget to update the version number, the changelog (in the `readme.md` file), and when applicable, the documentation.
