## Getting Started

### 1. Include Snapshot on your site.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/snapshot-css.css">
```

Snapshot is [built with Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for easy customization. If you don't use Sass, that's ok. The `css` folder contains compiled vanilla CSS.

The `_config.scss` and `_mixins.scss` files are the same ones used in [Kraken](http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/), so you can drop the `_snapshot.css` file right into Kraken without making any updates. Or, adjust the variables to suit your own project.

### 2. Add the markup to your HTML.

```html
<img class="img-circle" src="#">
<img class="img-border" src="#">
<img class="img-photo" src="#">
```

Add simple `.img-*` classes to any `img` element to add styling. You can combine classes for additional styling options. Mix-and-match as desired.

And that's it, you're done. Nice work!



## Browser Compatibility

Because IE 8 and lower do not support the `border-radius` property, `.img-circle` will not work in those browsers.

Snapshot is fully supported by IE 9 and higher, and all modern browsers.
